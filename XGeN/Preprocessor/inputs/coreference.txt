The Lorrys were an old family in Minneapolis, grown a little harassed and poor since the war. Mrs. Lorry, a contemporary of Tom's, was not surprised that he should send mother and daughter orchids and dine them luxuriously in his apartment on fresh caviar, quail and champagne.Annie saw him only dimly-he lacked vividness, as the old do for the young-but she perceived his interest in her and performed for him the traditional ritual of young beauty smiles, polite, wide-eyed attention, a profile held obligingly in this light or in that. At the ball he danced with her twice, and, though she was teased about it, she was flattered that such a man of the world he had become that instead of a mere old man-had singled her out. She accepted his invitation to the symphony the following week, with the idea that it would be uncouth to refuse.
